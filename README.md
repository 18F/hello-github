# hello github

This is an instruction repository designed to help new TTS employees onboard to
GitHub. It encourages learning by doing: every new employee is supposed to make
a pull request in this repository and see a welcome message posted to the
`#welcomes` slack channel!

## Who

New employees at TTS who don't feel comfortable in GitHub.

## Why

GitHub is an essential tool to our work at TTS. We use it to host nearly all of
our code, most of which is open-source. However, comfort levels with GitHub vary
widely across TTS. And especially given that the [TTS RFC
process](https://github.com/18f/tts-rfc) is now
conducted mostly on GitHub, it is imperative that all TTS staff feel comfortable
with this tool.

## What

We have a number of goals with this approach to learning GitHub:

- Goal 1
- Another goal
- A third goal
